# String-Constructor in C++

Welcome to the String-Constructor project implemented in C++!
- Made in October-November 2023

## Overview

This C++ project provides a highly efficient String-Constructor capable of processing strings of up to 50,000 characters in less than 10 seconds. The String-Constructor is designed to recreate a target string using the append and clone operations with specified costs. The goal is to find the most cost-effective way to reconstruct the target string by strategically choosing between character append and substring cloning.

## Features

1. **High Performance:**
   - The String-Constructor is optimized for processing large strings, achieving very quick results even for strings with 50,000 characters.

2. **Cost-Effective Reconstruction:**
   - Given a target string and defined costs for append and clone operations, the constructor determines the most cost-effective sequence of operations.

3. **Dynamic Programming and Backtracking:**
   - The project leverages Dynamic Programming and Backtracking algorithms to efficiently explore and optimize the reconstruction process.

## String-Constructor Logic

- The String-Constructor operates on the principles of cost optimization, strategically choosing between appending characters and cloning substrings.
